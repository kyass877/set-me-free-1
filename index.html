    <h1>Set Me Free</h1>
    <h2>By Khalil Yassin</h2>
    <p>I choose to do this as my final project because I believe that people hide behind masks to please others. The meaning behind the image is that we put on the mask so much that it basically becomes our natural face. The meaning behind the music is that it has a sort of sad tone to it and it has someone screaming to run from your mask. Donâ€™t let it take over who you really are.</p>
